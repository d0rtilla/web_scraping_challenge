# web_scraping_challenge
For this challenge, I was tasked with using BeautifulSoup to scrape data about the planet Mars, and then using PyMongo and Flask to load the data into a database and visualize the data with a flask app that can also update the data by scraping the websites again.

# Unit 12 Homework: Mission to Mars

In this assignment, you will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following information outlines what you need to do.

## Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `web-scraping-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**. 

1. Clone the new repository to your computer.

1. Add your notebook files and your Flask app to this folder.

1. Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Instructions 

The instructions for this assignment are divided into three parts: 

1. Scraping 

2. MongoDB and Flask Application

3. Submission 

## Part  1: Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb`. Use this file to complete all your scraping and analysis tasks. The following information outlines what you need to scrape.

### NASA Mars News

* Scrape the [Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

```python
# Example showing how to assign text to a variable: 
news_title = "NASA's Next Mars Mission to Investigate Interior of Red Planet"

news_p = "Preparation of NASA's next spacecraft to Mars, InSight, has ramped up this summer, on course for launch next May from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California -- the first interplanetary launch in history from America's West Coast."
```

### JPL Mars Space Images—Featured Image

* Visit the URL for the Featured Space Image site [here](https://spaceimages-mars.com).

* Use Splinter to navigate the site and find the image URL for the current Featured Mars Image, then assign the URL string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

* Be sure to find the image URL to the full-sized `.jpg` image.

* Be sure to save a complete URL string for this image.

```python
# Example:
featured_image_url = 'https://spaceimages-mars.com/image/featured/mars2.jpg'
```

### Mars Facts

* Visit the [Mars Facts webpage](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including diameter, mass, etc.

* Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visit the [astrogeology site](https://marshemispheres.com/) to obtain high-resolution images for each hemisphere of Mars.

* You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image URL to the full-resolution image.

* Save the image URL string for the full resolution hemisphere image and the hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys `img_url` and `title`.

* Append the dictionary with the image URL string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.

```python
# Example:
hemisphere_image_urls = [
    {"title": "Valles Marineris Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Cerberus Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Schiaparelli Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Syrtis Major Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
]
```

## Part 2: MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Create a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` that contains a function called `scrape()`. This function `scrape()` should execute all the scraping code from your Jupyter notebook and return one Python dictionary that contains all of the scraped data (i.e., take the code from your notebook and use it to populate this function called `scrape`; modify as necessary to return the dictionary). 

* Next, create a Flask route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function. Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Create an index route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the Mars data into an HTML template for displaying the data.

* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the Mars data dictionary and display all the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.

## Part 3: Submission

To submit your work to BootCampSpot, create a new GitHub repository and upload the following:

1. The Jupyter notebook containing the scraping code used

2. Screenshots of your final application

Ensure your repository has regular commits and a detailed `README.md` file. Then, submit the link to your new repository. 


## Hints

* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.

* Use PyMongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.

* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
